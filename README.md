# Jukebox

The community center of Reactville is launching an exciting projectâ€”a public jukebox! Your task is to help them build an interactive user interface where everyone can collaborate to manage the track library. Users will be able to add, update, and remove tracks, creating a dynamic playlist that all residents can enjoy at town events!
